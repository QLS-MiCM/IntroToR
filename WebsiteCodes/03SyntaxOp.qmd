------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax operators are the specialized symbols and keywords that define how R interprets your code. They handle essential tasks like naming objects, writing notes to yourself, and digging into complex datasets.

It includes comment line, assignation, access content, and equal.

## 1. Comments (`#`): Writing Notes to Your Future Self

Comments are used to explain **why** you wrote a specific line of code. This is vital for reproducibility and collaboration. Anything written after the `#` symbol is ignored by R during execution.

-   **Manual:** Type `#` before your note.
-   **Shortcut (Mac):** `Cmd + Shift + C`
-   **Shortcut (Windows):** `Ctrl + Shift + C`

```{r}
# This is a comment. R will not execute this.
# "hello world"
```

::: callout-note
The shortcut is "smart." If you **highlight ten lines of code and** **hit the shortcut**, it will comment out all ten lines at once. Hit it again to "**uncomment**" them.
:::

::: callout-note
It doesn't matter how many `#` symbols you use.

R simply looks for the *first* one on a line and ignores everything to the right of it. You are free to use multiple hashtags to create visual hierarchy in your script:

```{r}
#-----------------------------------------------------------
## MAIN SECTION: DATA CLEANING
#-----------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Remove outliers
# The following line filters out p-values above 0.05
```

**Best Practices for Commenting**

1.  **Don't explain "What":** R (and yourself) knows *what* the code is doing.

    -   *Bad:* `# Adding 1 to x`

2.  **Explain "Why":** Explain the scientific logic.

    -   *Good:* `# Adjusting for batch effect`

3.  **Use them as "Bookmarks":** Use long lines of hashtags to separate your "Loading Data" section from your "Plotting" section.

## 2. Assignment: Creating Objects

Assignment is the process of storing a value (data) inside a named container (an object).

### 2.1 The Left-Hand Assignment (\<-)

The standard way to assign values in R is using the \<- operator. Think of it as an arrow pointing from the data to the label.

```{r}
# The convention is to use left hand assignation 
var1 <- "hello world"
var1
```

::: callout-note
**Shortcut for \<-**

Instead of typing two characters, use these shortcuts to insert the assignment arrow:

-   Mac: Option + - (minus key)

-   Windows: Alt + - (minus key)
:::

::: callout-note
**A Note on Coding Style: To Space or Not to Space?**

While var1\<-"hello world" works, it is a little bit "dirty" and hard to read.

Following the Tidyverse Style Guide, you should always put a space before and after the assignment operator: `var1 <- "hello world"`
:::

### 2.2 Other Assignment Methods

#### **2.2.1 The Equals Sign (=):**

While = works for assignment, R users generally avoid it. In R, = is typically reserved for defining arguments inside a function. Using it for general assignment is considered poor style.

```{r}
# It is also possible to use the '=' sign, but is NOT a good practice
var1 = "hello world"
var1
```

#### **2.2.2 Right-Hand Assignment (-\>):**

You can technically point the arrow the other way: `"data" -> var1.`

This is rarely used but can be helpful at the end of a long pipe (\|\>) if you decide to save the final result into a new variable.

```{r}
"hello world" -> var1
var1
```

### 2.3 Printing Variables

Once you have stored data in a variable, there are several ways to "call" it back to the console:

#### **2.3.1 Direct Call**

Simply type the name. This is the most common method during interactive analysis.

```{r}
"hello world!"
```

#### **2.3.2 Using Function print() and cat()**

**print():** Explicitly prints the object. This is often used inside "loops" or complex functions where R might not automatically show the output.

**cat():** Short for "concatenate." It prints the raw text without the \[1\] index marker or quotes. It is great for creating clean, human-readable messages.

```{r}
var1 <- "McGill"
print(var1)
```

```{r}
var1 <- "McGill"
cat(var1)
```

## 3. Access Content (\$)

The \$ operator is one of the most powerful symbols in R. It allows you to "reach inside" a complex object (like a Data Frame or a List) and extract a specific column or element by its name.

**Example: The `iris` Dataset**

The `iris` dataset is a built-in collection of measurements for 150 flowers. It includes variables like `Sepal.Length`, `Petal.Length`, and `Species`. To look at *only* the species column, we use the `$` operator.

```{r}
# Show the first 6 rows of the dataset
head(iris)

# Extract only the "Species" column
iris$Species
```

::: callout-note
The head() Function

The head() function is a "quick look" tool. It returns the first few rows of a dataset (default is 6) so you can inspect your data without flooding your console with thousands of lines.

Conversely, tail() shows you the last few rows.

Remember, you can always type ?head in your Console to see the full documentation.

## 4. The Equal Operator (=)

In R, the single equals sign (=) has two primary roles, but they are not created equal.

### **4.1 Assignment (Not Recommended)**

While `=` can be used to assign a value to a variable, R users generally avoid this. In the R community, using `=` for assignment is considered poor style because it can be confused with mathematical equality or function arguments.

**Always prefer `<-` for creating variables.**

```{r}
# It is also possible to use the '=' sign, but is NOT a good practice
var1 = "hello world"
var1
```

### **4.2 Defining Function Arguments (Recommended)**

The "correct" and most common use of the = sign in R is to define arguments inside a function. This tells the function exactly how you want it to behave.

**Example:** The `paste()` Function

The `paste()` function joins multiple pieces of text together. It uses an argument called `sep` to decide what character should go between the pieces.

```{r}
cal <- 1 + 3

# Using '=' to define the separator argument
paste("The output of 1 + 3", cal,
      sep = " = ")
```

::: callout-note
**Deep Dive: ?paste**

If you look at the help documentation for paste(), you will see the usage and arguments explanations:

**Usage**

paste(..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL)

**Arguments**

**sep:** a character string to separate the terms.

By using sep = " = ", we are overriding the default space (" ") and telling R to put an equals sign between our text and our result.
