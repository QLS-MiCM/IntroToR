## 1. Customize Your Own Functions

![](../images/Functions.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}

Writing functions is the best way to keep your code **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself). If you find yourself copy-pasting code three times, it’s time to write a function.

### The Anatomy of a Function

A function has three parts:

1.  **Input (Arguments):** What the function needs to work (e.g., a vector of numbers).

2.  **Body:** The actual code/math being performed.

3.  **Output (Return):** What the function gives back to you.

```{r}
# Example: Creating a manual version of the 'mean' function
new_mean <- function(values) {
  # The 'Body'
  result <- sum(values) / length(values)
  
  # The 'Return' (Output)
  return(result)
}

# Test it out
x <- 1:5
new_mean(x)
```

### **Pro-Tip: When to use `return()`**

In R, the function will automatically return the **very last line** of code executed inside the braces. However, using the explicit `return()` function is a "Best Practice" because it makes it much clearer to other researchers exactly what your function is providing.
