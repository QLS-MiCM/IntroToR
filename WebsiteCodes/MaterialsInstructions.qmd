## How Code is Demonstrated

Throughout these materials, we use live-rendered code blocks to demonstrate R's functionality. This means the results you see on the website were generated by the code right above them.

### **The Code Block**

You will see code blocks with a **copy button** in the top-right corner.

-   To try it yourself: Click copy and paste the code into your RStudio Source Editor or Console.
-   To run it: Use the shortcuts `Cmd + Return` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows).
-   *If you need a refresher on running code, refer to [Get Acquainted with R and RStudio Section - 3.2.4: Executing Code](RStudio.qmd#executing-code).*

### **The Output**

Immediately following the code block, you will see the results. These lines represent the exact output you will see in your RStudio Console on your own computer.

## How the Workshop is Structured

We follow a **"Walk-through and Practice"** model:

1.  **Interactive Review:** We will first go through the online materials together to establish the core concepts.

2.  **Hands-on Session:** We will then transition to RStudio on your individual computers to practice coding in real-time.

The code on this website serves as a reference guide, but the real learning happens when you type and troubleshoot on your own machine.

## Why a Website Instead of Slides?

Traditional slides can often be a barrier to learning code for a few reasons:

-   **The "Setup" Lag:** In many workshops, significant time is lost waiting for everyone to reach the same setup step, causing faster students to lose momentum.

-   **Information Density:** Long, dense slides can be distracting. It is easy to lose your place, and once you fall behind, it is difficult to catch up.

-   **Self-Paced Learning:** As someone who values clear, manageable steps, I designed this format to be **beginner-friendly**. You can stop, re-read, and continue at any time.

This website is intended to be a living resource—something you can study at your own pace during the workshop and return to for review later in your research.

## Behind the Scenes: How this Site was Built

This site is built using **Quarto** and **Markdown**, hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

Markdown is a lightweight text-editing language that is excellent for combining professional page layouts with live code. Much like LaTeX, it is a powerful tool for academic writing, and learning it will help you in your own research documentation!
