**Comparison operators** are used to compare two values. When you run a comparison, R evaluates the statement and returns a **Logical** value: either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

> | Operator |         Name         | Example  | Plain English                 |
> |:---------|:--------------------:|:---------|:------------------------------|
> | `==`     |     **Equal to**     | `x == y` | Is x exactly equal to y?      |
> | `!=`     |   **Not equal to**   | `x != y` | Is x different from y?        |
> | `>`      |   **Greater than**   | `x > y`  | Is x strictly larger than y?  |
> | `<`      |    **Less than**     | `x < y`  | Is x strictly smaller than y? |
> | `>=`     | **Greater or equal** | `x >= y` | Is x at least y or larger?    |
> | `<=`     |  **Less or equal**   | `x <= y` | Is x at most y or smaller?    |

**Logical operators** allow you to combine multiple comparison statements into a single test. This is essential for complex data filtering.

> | Operator | Description |
> |:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
> | `&` | **Element-wise Logical AND operator.** Returns TRUE if both elements are TRUE. |
> | `|` | **Element-wise Logical OR operator.** Returns TRUE if one of the statements is TRUE. |
> | `!` | **Logical NOT.** Returns FALSE if statement is TRUE; Reverses the result (TRUE becomes FALSE). |
> | `%in%` | **Contains/Membership.** Checks if a value belongs to a set. |

## 1. Comparison operators

### 1.1 `==`

::: callout-warning
The Most Common R Error: `=` vs `==`

`=` (or `<-`) is for Assignment: You are telling R that a variable equals a value.

`==` is for Comparison: You are asking R if two things are equal.
:::

```{r}
# Comparing numbers
10 == 2

# Comparing text (Case sensitive!)
"McGill" == "mcgill"
```

### 1.2 `!=`

In R, the exclamation mark `!` stands for **"NOT"**. When combined with the equals sign, `!=` checks if two values are **different**.

-   It returns `TRUE` if the values are **not** the same.
-   It returns `FALSE` if they **are** the same.

```{r}
# Is 10 equal to 2? (False)
10 == 2

# Is 10 different from 2? (True)
10 != 2
```

## 2. Logical operators

### 2.1 `&`

The "AND" Operator (&): Use this when your condition must meet all criteria simultaneously.

```{r}
age <- 65
bmi <- 32

# Is the patient over 60 AND obese (BMI > 30)?
age > 60 & bmi > 30
```

### 2.2 `|`

The "OR" Operator (`|`): Use this when meeting any one of the criteria is sufficient.

```{r}
# Is the flower species either 'setosa' OR 'versicolor'?
species <- "setosa"
species == "setosa" | species == "versicolor"
```

::: callout-note
**Keyboard Tip:** How to type `|`?

Look for the key with the backslash `\` (usually above the Return/Enter key).

-   **Mac & Windows:** Press `Shift + \`
:::

### 2.3 `!`

The "NOT" Operator (!): This exclamation mark is used to exclude specific data points.

```{r}
!TRUE
```

```{r}
control_group <- FALSE
# Is the sample NOT in the control group?
!control_group
```

### 2.4 The Membership Operator (%in%)

The %in% operator (often called "contains") is extremely useful when you want to check if a value belongs to a large list or group.

Example: Searching for Genes Imagine you have a list of "Genes of Interest" for your diabetes research. You can check if a specific gene is in that list without writing many OR statements.

```{r}
#| collapse: true
diabetes_genes <- c("INS", "GCK", "KCNJ11", "SLC30A8")

# Is 'INS' (Insulin) in our list?
"INS" %in% diabetes_genes

# Is 'SOX2' in our list?
"SOX2" %in% diabetes_genes
```
